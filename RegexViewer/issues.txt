- deleting new filter row does not come back automatically

- grouping from quick search doesnt work with other filters

- only first save to exe.config works - have to make a class and use reflection

- opening bad filter error? should i put a regex header in xml?

- log save as not filtering output when saving

- countmaskedmatches not working until its threaded

- opening / switching log tabs does not use dynamic filter if one is set - wait until its threaded

- changing a colored filter item to an exclusion doesnt remove the colors

- closing tab without selecting tab first closes wrong one because of selectedindex not being updated

- when reading in filter xml that has been escaped for xml : (?&lt;test&gt;.*) is the filter pattern
